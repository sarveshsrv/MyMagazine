For Saint Laurent's summer 2021 campaign, which originally debuted in the African desert at the end of 2020, creative director Anthony Vacarello enlisted icons only. The cast includes familiar faces of the Parisian atelier: French actress and all-around legend Charlotte Gainsbourg, Julianne Moore, Indya Moore, Leo Reilly, and Chloe Sevigny. The film is directed by indie moviemaker Jim Jarmusch, 

An icon in his own right, known for his ability to create insular moods and emotional 
atmospheres. In the short film for Saint Laurent, he does just that.

The scene opens in an empty banquet hall with the remnants of a party still on the tables and floors, with the storyline following each character as they search for one another. From the mirrored entryway comes Julianne Moore and Chloë Sevigny, Moore in a striking red suit, and Sevigny in a flowing maribou-lined black silk blouse and leggings. They’re wandering around the space wondering where their friend Indya Moore has gone off to.

Next to the scene is Gainsbourg, who doesn’t interact with anyone and exists as a pseudo ghost haunting the party, wearing a white wool short jumpsuit and a black patent trench, stalking the long-over fête like a fancy French ghost. She mystifies the lone waiter, played by the perennially adorable Leo Reilly, awaiting nobody with a tray of water, which he’s sure to remind everyone is French l'eau.
